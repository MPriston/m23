Details of how to do Retro 3
</summary>

* Review how to do a retro: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html>
* Then, go to your folder on Google Drive (the link should be pinned to your slack channel)
* Create a new document Retro3 similar to Retro1 and Retro2
* Conduct a retro following the same basic instructions from here:
  - <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lectures/week05a/#retrospective-the-heart-of-agile>

Before deciding on a new experiment, **have a discussion of the experiment from your last retro**.
- Read the experiment from your Retro2 document.
- In your Retro3 document, make a section "Retro2 Experiment"
- Copy/paste the description of the experiment.
- Then, invite each member of the team to write something on the slack channel indicating whether they thought
  the experiment had a successful outcome, a failed outcome, an indeterminate outcome (can't tell) or a mix,
  and why.  But don't press enter until there's a signal that everyone is finished.
- Then you call all press enter and see what each other wrote.
- Discuss. If possible come to a consensus summary.  If a consensus doesn't emerge after a few minutes of discussion,
  then you can "agree to disagree".
- Write down either a summary of your consensus, or a summary of your differing opinions.

Then, come up with a new experiment for this Retro.  It can be a variation on the old one (i.e. a different approach to the same problem), or could be entirely different (some other aspect of the team's performance.)
