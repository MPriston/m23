  - If not, then that's too bad.
 

## For Everyone

* Every team member should locate a PR they *code reviewed* that was merged into main; if there's more than one, choose the on that best shows off your code reviewing skills.  Post a link to that PR in the team slack channel with the text `My best Code Review`

* Important: Bonus points (the extra credit points between 100 and 200) are only available for PRs that are *mergeable by staff at or before 9am Friday*.
* Discuss as a team: do you want to continue working on coding and PRs, or start on your release notes/final presentation?
* If you want to continue, what are you your best candidates from the remaining PRs to get merged by Friday afternoon?
