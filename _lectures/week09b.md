# Today

* Start with standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.

# Did your team complete the priority issues?

If not, points may be deducted from your team's final project grade, and your team is not eligible for bonus points.  So be sure that these were done completely!

For Happycows, those are [these](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AM23+label%3APRIORITY)
* Track Periodic Statistics: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/issues/66> (20 pts) 
* Capacity Per Farmer: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/issues/65> (20 pts)

For Gauchoride, those are: [these](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AM23+label%3APRIORITY)
* User can add cell phone: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride/issues/62> (20 pts)
* Clarify pickup/dropoff: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride/issues/61> (20 pts)
* Driver Shift CRUD: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride/issues/44> (20 pts)

You are strongly encouraged to double check this and post about it in the team channel.

# Surveys coming soon

* ESCIs: please don't forget to fill them out! They are super important.
* CATME surveys
* End of quarter extra credit (research survey)

# Today:

## If your team isn't yet at 100 points:

* Do a standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Look at the PRs you have and get everything code reviewed that's ready to be code reviewed
* Work to get things merged
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.
* We will continue to review PRs and allow you to work on them until at least midnight Friday.
* After midnight Friday:
  - If it's mergeable, it's mergeable and you'll get the points.
  - If not, then that's too bad.
 

## For Everyone

Optional but *highly recommended* as preparation for takehome final exam
* Every team member should locate a PR they *authored* that was merged into main; if there's more than one, choose the one that best shows off your skills and your contributions to the team's success.  Post a link to that PR in the team slack channel with the text `My best PR`
* Every team member should locate a PR they *code reviewed* that was merged into main; if there's more than one, choose the on that best shows off your code reviewing skills.  Post a link to that PR in the team slack channel with the text `My best Code Review`

## If your team is already at 100 points but not yet at 200 or more:

* Important: Bonus points (the extra credit points between 100 and 200) are only available for PRs that are *mergeable by staff at or before 9am Friday*.
* Discuss as a team: do you want to continue working on coding and PRs, or start on your release notes/final presentation?
* If you want to continue, what are you your best candidates from the remaining PRs to get merged by Friday afternoon?
* Make a post with the team consensus and tag Prof. Conrad
* List the top three contenders (with links to the PRs) and give a brief explanation of where each one stands.
* Or, start planning your video (see below)

## If your team is already at 200 or more:

* Start planning your video (see below).


# Week 10 Tuesday and Thursday are for presentations

The instructions for the final video are listed below.
* The final video presentations will take place Tuesday and Thursday of next week.
* You are not required to attend in person, but you are required to participate;
  - There's a participation grade for providing feedback on one another's presentations
  - There's a live demo component as well, and your team needs to be represented there.

# Notes about the final exam
  
The final exam will be an online take home exam, and will be mainly high level questions about the process of software development that you learned in team01, team02, team03 and the legacy code project.

There may be questions about any of the following.  If you've been paying attention all along, you shouldn't really need to "cram".  The answers should be pretty much in your knowledge base already.

* Agile processes, e.g. standups, retrospectives, the role of a product owner/manager
* GitHub tools and their interaction with Agile processes: using feature branches, issues, Kanban board, Pull requests, code review
* General Web Development concepts, e.g.: Backend vs. Frontend
* Some Spring Boot specifics: controllers, services, use of Swagger
* Some React specifics: components, use of Storybook
* Testing in general: unit testing, test coverage, mutation testing
* Spring Boot Testing: Role of JUnit, Jacoco, Pitest, Mocking and Stubbing
* React Testing: role of jest, and Stryker
* Using third party APIs and representing data with JSON (as we did in team01, and later phases as well.)

I'll be asking questions about these topics that I think are the type you might be asked as a job interview.  So if you study, study the way you would for a job interview.

# Please do not collaborate on your exam answers.

* Identical text is unlikely to occur if each of you is working indepenently and writing in your own words.
* If you are copying/pasting text from an online source (e.g. to explain what a retrospective is) be sure that you use "quotation marks" around direct quotations, and **cite your source.**
  
  Otherwise, you are liable to end up triggering the suspicion of academic dishonesty because of the similarity of your text to someone else that happens to be
  using the same source.
  
  Also: relying too much on direct quotes rather than putting things in your own words may result in lower grades; if you have to quote others too much, 
  it suggests that you have not really internalized the content, but have to rely on others understanding.  So use direct quotes sparingly, if at all; try instead
  to answer in your own words.
  
 
Academic integrity investigations are unpleasant for everyone, and they don't help anyone learn. 

I really dont want to spend my time on those, so please don't create conditions where I have to do that.

Work independently, and let your learning speak for itself.

# Clarity and consiseness counts

* Small grammar / spelling errors may or may not be penalized; if an interviewer would be confused by the answer, or have some doubt as to your understanding,
  then they count.   If there is no doubt about your understanding, I'm liable to be more lenient.
* Make sure your answers are clear and understandable.
* Do not just do an information dump of everything you know about the topic, or everything you can possibly find online about the topic.  An employer wants someone to answer
* their question, and they also want someone that makes good use of their time.  Don't waste the interviewer's time.
