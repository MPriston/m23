## Introducting the legacy code project (10 minutes mini-lecture/discussion)

We'll go over this material:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lab/project.html>

Please pay attention during this discussion; it's short, and it has important information about 25% of your course grade.

## Fill out CATME PeerEval3 **now** (in class, but after announcements)

If you didn't already fill out your CATME PeerEval3 survey, please do it now.  You may spread out at the unused tables for privacy; when finished return to your original table and start preparing for the retro.

Everyone should finish the CATME survey before starting today's retro.

Please **don't work on that during Conrad's announcements** though.   The announcements are short and have important information about
how the legacy code project will work.

## Retro3 (approx 2:15-2:45)

## Sprint Planning (approx 2:45-3:15pm)

Goal: Each team member should have an issue in the "in progress" column on Kanban board before you leave today.


What to do: 
* Look over the issues list for your repo (see issues link in table below)
* Find an issue to work on, and claim it; **discuss this with your team**
  * If it's a large issue, consider working in pairs.
  * Go into the issue, find the place that says `Assignees` / `No oneâ€”assign yourself` and click to assign yourself (and your pair).

  * But note that you **may need to create smaller issues from it**
  * While some issues are small and can be moved onto the Kanban board directly, some issues are "epics" that need to be decomposed into smaller issues first!  
* If your issue needs to be broken down, create at least one smaller issue (the first one you plan to work on), and add it to your issues list.
* Assign that smaller issue to yourself, and add it to the Kanban board.

For more information on sprint plannings, see: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lab/project.html>

Optional:
* If your team finds it helpful, you can create an extra columns on the Kanban board called "Epics in Progress" and "Epics Done".
* In this column you can add the issues for any Epics the team is working on, and move them to Done when complete.
* Some teams also add a column for the "Icebox", which is a place that stories go when the team has decided *not* to work on them in the near future, but might come back to them later if/when other work is finished.
